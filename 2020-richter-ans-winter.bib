	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to support public discussions on possible changes to guidance documents associated with population-related siting considerations for advanced reactors.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has established regulations and guidance to implement a policy of siting nuclear reactors away from very densely populated centers. The NRC’s guidance and experience for siting nuclear power plants mostly relate to large light-water
reactors (LWRs). The siting of large LWRs is based on an assumed severe accident with
substantial melting of the core and the subsequent large release of radioactive material from the plant.

Compared to previous generations of reactor designs, advanced reactor designs are expected to have a reduced likelihood of accidents and to involve a smaller and slower release of radioactive material in the unlikely event of an accident. Through its interactions with stakeholders, the NRC staff has identified the issue of population-related siting considerations
for advanced reactors as a matter that warrants possible actions by the NRC.},

	abstract = {This report analyzes the alternatives to using a formula distance as the primary figure of merit for siting
small modular reactors (SMRs) or non-light water reactors (non-LWRs). Some reactor vendors use a
business plan that sites reactors close to an industrial partner to supply heat or to back-fit a reactor at a
fossil plant site to take advantage of existing infrastructure. Factors such as smaller source terms (fission
product release to the environment), passive safety systems, advances in barrier technology, advances in
simulation and modeling, and improved understanding of societal risk may allow for siting these types of
reactors closer to densely populated centers than has historically been accepted for large LWRs.},

@article{nagley_fabrication_2010,
	title = {Fabrication of {Uranium} {Oxycarbide} {Kernels} for {HTR} {Fuel}},
	abstract = {Babcock and Wilcox (B\&W) has been producing high quality uranium oxycarbide (UCO) kernels for Advanced Gas Reactor (AGR) fuel tests at the Idaho National Laboratory. In 2005, 350-μm, 19.7\% 235U-enriched UCO kernels were produced for the AGR-1 test fuel. Following coating of these kernels and forming the coated-particles into compacts, this fuel was irradiated in the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) from December 2006 until November 2009. B\&W produced 425-μm, 14\% enriched UCO kernels in 2008, and these kernels were used to produce fuel for the AGR-2 experiment that was inserted in ATR in 2010. B\&W also produced 500μm, 9.6\% enriched UO2 kernels for the AGR-2 experiment. Kernels of the same size and enrichment as AGR-1 were also produced for the AGR-3/4 experiment. In addition to fabricating enriched UCO and UO2 kernels, B\&W has produced more than 100 kg of natural uranium UCO kernels which are being used in coating development tests. Successive lots of kernels have demonstrated consistent high quality and also allowed for fabrication process improvements. Improvements in kernel forming were made subsequent to AGR-1 kernel production. Following fabrication of AGR-2 kernels, incremental increases in sintering furnace charge size have been demonstrated. Recently small scale sintering tests using a small development furnace equipped with a residual gas analyzer (RGA) have increased understanding of how kernel sintering parameters affect sintered kernel properties. The steps taken to increase throughput and process knowledge have reduced kernel production costs. Studies have been performed of additional modifications toward the goal of increasing capacity of the current fabrication line to use for production of first core fuel for the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) and providing a basis for the design of a full scale fuel fabrication facility.},
